                    It's a scientific fact that everyone likes to answer
                    questions when the outcome doesn't matter and the content is
                    enlightening or silly. It's also widely known that people
                    are competitive and want to prove how much they know. That's
                    why you should build a quiz and send it to your friends. And
                    since you're already here at Quiz Builder, why not start
                    here?
